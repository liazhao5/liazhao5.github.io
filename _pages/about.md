Hello, my name is Liang ZHAO, and I am currently pursuing my PhD degree in Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong, under the guidance of Prof. [Qingfu ZHANG](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/qingfu-zhang(a25373cf-62a1-4697-ad08-43678bcbf3f2).html). Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi‚Äôan, China, in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My studies there were conducted under the supervision of Prof. [Baowei SONG](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/songbaowei.html). 

My research interests include multiobjective optimization, Bayesian optimization, and and their applications.
